# tune-bot

tune-bot is simply a way for users to create custom music playlists. 
It can be used as a personal music playing app on Android or iOS with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay integrations.
What makes it unique is that you can have a central audio player playing a combination of each present user's enabled playlists.
Users can blacklist certain songs so that if other users have it in their playlists, it will not play.
This makes it easy for people hanging out together to play a mix of music that everyone can enjoy,
without having to first spend a lot of time searching for and queueing up songs.
Each user can have their playlists saved and ready to go, and modify their playlists and blacklist at any time.
The central audio player can be in the form of a Discord voice channel, or the mobile applications.
